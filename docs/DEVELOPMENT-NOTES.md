# Deferred work

## Volume-key hold with accessibility enabled — 2026-11-02

The user reports that holding volume +/− changes volume only once while tvOS is
enabled in Accessibility; repeat works after disabling the service. The user
explicitly deferred this issue until structural separation is finished.

`RemoteKeyService` requests global key filtering for app-button assignments.
`RemoteKeys` normally returns false for volume keys. The exact failure point is
unconfirmed; do not attribute it to a proven firmware bug yet. First compare key
down/up/repeat events with the service enabled and disabled. If a repeat fallback
is needed, preserve native repeats, stop on release/service shutdown and avoid
applying volume twice. No volume-handling change is part of this refactoring pass.
